## Presentation
We propose a social network based on rural and urban farming. Our central feature is the garden. Gardens are items that user can create to share content about their real life gardens on agenda's events: what did they plant, when did they do it, when did they water etc. A post can be published on gardens to share more general content.

## Stories
A simple visitor can visit users' gardens, see posts and comments, but cannot interact in any way.  
After signed up, a user can create gardens, publish posts and comments, as well as events and testimonies.  
A user can also signal posts and comments. This triggers a warning on admin dashboard, so administrators can easily delete sensitive content.
